"""Merge the per-section annotations of a book into one family tree: each person once, each relationship once.

    python -m annotate.merge <slug> [--out PATH]

Reads data/<slug>/output/sections.json and annotations/*.json, writes data/<slug>/output/tree.json.
If data/<slug>/curated/outside.json exists (python -m annotate.outside <slug>) its people and family links are
added as "outside the book" links; people are joined by name or alternate name, and a link the book itself
states stays a book link. People who are not named in the book appear only once someone they are connected
to has been reached (first_index is the earliest such section, or null if none).
Names are matched by spelling (accents and ligatures ignored) and by the aliases the model gave. Only plain
proper-name aliases ("Jove", "Phoebus") join two names; descriptive epithets such as "the son of Saturn" can
fit several people, so they are kept for display but never used to merge.

Two names that the model lists as separate characters in the same section are not merged unless the
aliases clearly say they are one person. Corrections go in data/<slug>/curated/aliases.json:
    {"merge": [["Phoebus", "Apollo"]], "separate": [["Apollo", "Diana"]],
     "remove": [["Atlas", "parent_of", "Jupiter"]],
     "add": [["Phoebe the Titaness", "parent_of", "Latona", "optional note"]],
     "about": {"Phoebe the Titaness": "Titaness of brightness; grandmother of Apollo"}}
"remove" deletes a wrong relationship, whether the book model or the outside layer produced it. "add" supplies
a missing one (parent_of, spouse_of, sibling_of, lover_of or transformed_into); it is drawn as an outside link,
and names that are not in the book become new people. "about" sets the one-line description shown on click.

If data/<slug>/output/wikidata.json exists (python -m annotate.verify <slug>) the tree is checked against
Wikidata, for every book:
  - names matched to different entries are never joined (the sun is not Apollo); names matched to the same
    entry are joined, and so are a Roman god and its Greek counterpart, and a god and the thing it personifies;
  - a parent link that Wikidata states the other way round is turned round;
  - a "parent" who is really a grandparent is dropped (the book said "his mother's father");
  - any other link that Wikidata contradicts is dropped if it came from outside the book, and kept but marked
    "differs" if the book itself states it;
  - Wikidata's own parent links between people of the book are added as outside links.
Hand corrections in aliases.json are applied last and always win. The report lists every change.

If data/<slug>/output/review.json exists (python -m annotate.review <slug>, Claude reading the whole tree once)
its decisions are applied too: names it found to be one being are joined, and names it found wrongly joined are kept
apart. Hand corrections win over these as well.

If data/<slug>/output/namesakes.json exists (python -m annotate.namesakes <slug>) different people who share a name
are kept apart: each section's entry for that name is given the name of the person it is.
