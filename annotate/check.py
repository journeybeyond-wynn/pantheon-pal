"""Check a book for the problems that have turned up before. Free: nothing is sent anywhere.

    python -m annotate.check <slug>            everything that exists so far: the parse, then annotations, tree, ...
    python -m annotate.check <slug> --parse    only the parse (use it before paying for annotation)

Each check prints one line: "ok", "note" (worth knowing, usually fine), "WARN" (look at it before going on) or
"FAIL" (the reader will show something wrong). Every check here exists because one of the first four books had
that fault: works called "Work 3", a last section that swallowed the endnotes, note numbers left in the text,
notes that were never joined to their sentences, a god with no key moments, a Wikipedia article about
something else.
