"""Footnotes that are listed at the end of a book and marked in the text by a bare number.

Some Project Gutenberg plain texts print a footnote marker as a number stuck to the word before it
("the other East.1 He had gone") and list the notes at the end ("[1] [ Black races are ...]"). Here each such
number becomes a proper marker ("East.[1] He had gone") and the note is attached to the section it is in, so the
reader can show it beside its sentence.

A number counts as a marker only if it is stuck to the text before it and is the next footnote in order, which
keeps real numbers ("12 ships") out of it.

Other texts number their notes by chapter ("1501 (return) [ Or perhaps 'a Scythian'.]") and print the marker after
a space ("Hesiod calls him Scythes 1501."). There a number is a marker if it is one of the listed numbers and
comes after the last marker found.

A third kind already prints its markers in brackets ("Arms and the man I sing,[1] who...") and lists the notes
under a "Notes" heading, book by book ("[1] 1:1. =Arms and the man I sing.= Compare..."), with lettered footnotes
("[B]") in a list of their own. There the text is left as it is and each note is attached to the section that
cites it. Such a list may also number its notes with a bare number at the start of a paragraph ("5 _i.e._ God
of embarcation."); that is trusted only when the numbers run 1, 2, 3 without a break.
